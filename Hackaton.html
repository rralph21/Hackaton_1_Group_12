        <p> Wendy is our rescued dog that has been with us since she was 5 weeks old and she is now 4 years old.</p>

        <h4> History </h4>
        <p>October of 2021 when we decided to foster animals, specifically dogs, from a rescue place called "Penny's all breed"</p>
        <p>One night, my wife went to pick up 2 puppies that desperately needed a place to stay.</p>
