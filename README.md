## Summary

Our theme for Hackaton 1 is "The Zoo". For this project, we've chosen to showcase our awesome pets along with animals that inspire and fascinate us. It's an open stage where every member of the group can express their creativity freely. Whether through fun, unique ideas or simple contributions. The only rule is that everything remains school and work appropriate, while encouraging imagination, collaboration and enjoyment.
